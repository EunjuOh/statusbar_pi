Statusbar Plugin for OpenCPN
=======================================

The status bar plugin provides customizable, easier to read output text
and lower cpu usage than the builtin statusbar.

Compiling
=========
You have to be able to compile OpenCPN itself - Get the info at http://opencpn.org/ocpn/developers_manual

Outside of the source tree:

* git clone git://github.com/seandepagnier/statusbar_pi.git

Under windows, you must find the file "opencpn.lib" (Visual Studio) or "libopencpn.dll.a" (mingw) which is built in the build directory after compiling opencpn.  This file must be copied to the plugin directory.

Build as normally:

* cd ..
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make
* make install
* make package
